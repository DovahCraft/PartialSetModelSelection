# PartialSetModelSelection
Implementation of an optimal model selection function using input from a partial set of segmentation models.


Goal is to expand on this [previous linear time algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02808) and complete breakpoint path computation in O(lgn) time using std::map as the core data structure.
